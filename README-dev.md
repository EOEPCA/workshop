# NOTES Preparing Workshop Materials

## Planning

* Use the demo cluster
  * Need to add more nodes
* Use global Resource Catalogue
* Use global Data Access
* Need workspace for processing outputs
  * Pre-create a workspace for each registered user
* Processing should use a 'light' algorthim that does not need to many resources, and runs quickly enough
* Participant pre-requisites:
  * Have docker installed
  * Pre-pull the workshop container image - `eoepca/workshop` (DockerHub)
